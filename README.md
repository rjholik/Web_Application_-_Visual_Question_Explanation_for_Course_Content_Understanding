# Visual Question Explanation for Enhanced Course Content Comprehension

**Unlock a new dimension of understanding** with our web application designed to clarify course content through interactive visual question explanations. Dive into an intuitive interface where complex concepts become accessible.

## Core Architecture

At the heart of our application is `app.py`, serving as the crucial bridge between our Python backend and the webserver, with Flask playing a dual role as both a framework and a webserver. This design ensures a seamless flow of information and a robust structure for our application.

### Flask Structure

- **Templates Directory**: Our `index.html` resides in the `templates` folder, adhering to Flask's organizational requirements for rendering the frontend seamlessly.
- **Static Directory**: This is the hub for our frontend assets. Within the `static` folder, you'll find all necessary HTML files and additional resources that shape the user experience on the web.
